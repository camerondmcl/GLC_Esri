## Project Description

This code works with a GIS application to find where different data sources are stored and record in a CSV file each time they are accessed in order to keep a record of how frequently different pieces of data are being used. I wrote the 'write_csv()' function to integrate into the rest of the code. This code was written for Python 2.7. A sample 'EsriCatalog.csv' output file is included. The tests (commented out) can be run but only if folder structure matching the test file paths are created on your computer.
